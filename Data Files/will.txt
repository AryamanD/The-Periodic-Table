Though scientists have discovered the elements up to number 118, no one can be  sure of whether or not there are remaining elements to add to the periodic      table. Chemist Elliot Quincy Adams predicted that no element could have an      atomic weight larger than 256.Chemist Richard Feynman also predicted that there would be an end to the periodic table. He calculated that an atom with 137 or   more protons would violate "special relativity," and would need electrons to    stabilize a positive charge packed together in the nucleus.
