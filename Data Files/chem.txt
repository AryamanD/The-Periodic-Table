The chemical elements classified into groups, periods, and blocks. Groups, also referred to as families, are the vertical columns located on the periodic table.Groups are considered to be the most significant form of classification. Many   groups contain elements with very similar properties and are referred to with   special names such as the halogens and alkaline earth metals. Periods are made  up of the horizontal rows of the table. Just as groups contain specific trends  in similar properties, so do periods. For instance, the d-block contains a row  of transition metals. Blocks are important as different regions of the periodic table due to the outer shell of elections within the elements' atoms. Blocks areoriented based on this outer shell. The blocks of the periodic table include thes-block, p-block, d-block, and f-block. Other groupings include poor metals,    transitional metals, metalloids, and the platinum group.
