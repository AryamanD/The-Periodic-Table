The structure of the periodic table is very significant. The current table holds118 elements in  very distinct order for the purpose of showing similarities anddifferences in chemical properties. Out of all of the elements, 94 are found in nature and the other 24 were synthetically produced with particle accelerators. As well, most copies of the periodic table separate the metal and non-metal     elements with the dark stair-step line. The metals are on the left and the      non-metals on the right. Additionally, elements are placed in order of          increasing atomic number, which is the number of protons in the nucleus of the  element's atom. The rows are also organized so that elements with similar       properties are found in the same columns. Within each element square,           information on the element's symbol, atomic number, atomic mass,                electronegativity, electron configuration, and valence numbers can be found. At the bottom of the periodic table is the two row block of elements that contain  the lanthanoids and actinides.These groups are classified as inner transitional metals.
